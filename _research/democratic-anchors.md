abstract: "Values are ideals of what is desirable for the individual, profession, organization, or institution. Institutional values attach to organizations because of their place in a political order, capturing broad governance concerns that extend beyond the details of management and technical administration. What institutional values do public administration scholars study, how do they study them, and how do those values relate to democracy? Our comprehensive and systematic review of the contents of public administration journals reveals ambiguity about the nature of values and the level of social structure at which they operate. As a constructive step forward, we offer an analytic framework of what we call democratic anchors, conceptions of values that convey essential democratic content, that can improve the empirical study of how democracy is operationalized into norms of practice in public administration."

## Introduction

The relationship between democratic governance and institutional values in public administration has long been a subject of scholarly inquiry, yet the field lacks a coherent framework for analyzing how these values operate within the institutions of governance. This study addresses a fundamental question: How are democratically relevant values operationalized into the norms of public-sector practice?

Public administration scholarship has increasingly focused on values as guiding principles for administrative action, but this literature suffers from conceptual ambiguity about the nature of values and the level of social structure at which they operate. Values can exist at the individual level (personal beliefs and motivations), professional level (occupational standards and ethics), organizational level (institutional culture and management practices), and institutional level (governance structures and democratic principles).

Our research distinguishes institutional values from other types of values, focusing specifically on those that attach to organizations because of their place in a political order. These institutional values capture broad governance concerns that extend beyond the details of management and technical administration, directly linking administrative practice to democratic ideals.

## Methodology

### Systematic Literature Review Design

We conducted a comprehensive systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Our methodology involved multiple search strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of the relevant literature:

**Database Searches**: We searched two major online databases - Scopus (cataloging 229 public administration journals) and Clarivate Web of Science (cataloging 90 journals). Our search terms included "values," "public administration," and related terms such as "principles," "public management," "public sector," "policy implementation," and "bureaucracy."

**Hand Searches**: We conducted targeted searches of 15 leading journals in public administration, selected based on journal rankings and expert recommendations. An online survey of 24 experts (70.8% tenured full professors, 12.5% tenured associate professors, and 16.7% assistant professors) helped identify the most relevant journals and suggested additional sources.

**Book Searches**: We searched the Google Books database to identify relevant monographs and edited volumes from prominent public administration and political science publishers, including Palgrave and Cambridge University Press.

**Temporal Scope**: Our search covered publications from January 1980 to March 2023, beginning with the New Public Administration movement which called for a more value-based approach to the field.

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Records were considered eligible if they: (a) were written in English; (b) contained theoretical or empirical content (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods); (c) helped conceptualize or empirically study institutional values; and (d) were published in peer-reviewed journals or prominent academic presses.

We excluded studies that focused exclusively on: (a) individual-level values; (b) single-organization values; (c) values as control variables without detailed exploration; (d) the "public value" perspective that treats values as outputs rather than criteria for action; and (e) context-specific studies with limited generalizability.

### Data Analysis

From an initial pool of 9,289 records, we used a two-stage screening process. Two team members independently screened titles and abstracts, with conflicts resolved through discussion. This yielded 290 records for full-text review, ultimately resulting in 92 records that met our inclusion criteria.

We employed a mixed-methods approach to data analysis, extracting information about: (a) the main topic of each study; (b) the specific values examined; and (c) whether values were explicitly identified as democratic or linked to democratic concepts.

## Key Findings

### Value Categories and Patterns

Our analysis identified **19 categories of institutional values** commonly discussed in the public administration literature:

**Most Frequently Mentioned Values:**
- **Efficiency** (72% of studies): Achieving maximum productivity and effectiveness with minimal waste
- **Answerability** (68%): Public servants and institutions being answerable for their actions  
- **Transparency** (57%): Processes that are visible and understandable to the public

**Moderately Discussed Values:**
- **Responsiveness** (54%): Addressing the needs and concerns of individuals and communities
- **System Value Reinforcement** (51%): Adherence to core principles supporting political and social systems
- **Equity** (49%): Equal opportunities and protections across all segments of society
- **Legality** (47%): Actions that are lawful within established legal frameworks

**Less Frequently Mentioned Values:**
Surprisingly, some values fundamental to democratic administration received relatively little attention, including participation (33%), equality (30%), balance (28%), impartiality (27%), and respect for collective will (16%).

### Democratic Values in the Literature

Only 47% of the studies in our sample contained explicit discussions of what they considered to be democratic values. This finding reveals a significant gap between the field's interest in values generally and its engagement with democratic values specifically.

Values most frequently identified as democratic included:
- **Transparency and Participation**: Most commonly linked to democratic ideals
- **Accountability and Responsiveness**: Frequently associated with democratic governance
- **Equity and Equality**: Often mentioned in democratic contexts, though with varying interpretations

### Geographic and Methodological Distribution

The research showed significant geographic concentration, with Europe (40.2%) and the Americas (39.3%) dominating the literature. The United States was the most studied context (34 studies), followed by the Netherlands (11), United Kingdom (10), and Canada (8). This concentration leaves much of the world, particularly developing countries, underrepresented.

Methodologically, qualitative studies comprised the plurality (43.5%), followed by theoretical papers (32.6%), quantitative studies (14.1%), and mixed-methods approaches (9.8%).

## Democratic Anchors Framework

### Conceptual Foundation

To address the conceptual confusion we identified, we developed an analytic framework of **eight democratic anchors**. These anchors represent mechanisms through which institutional values can be linked to fundamental democratic principles, providing both analytical clarity and practical guidance.

Our framework builds on a working definition of democracy as "a system of self-governance where individuals, guided by the rule of law, have an equal voice in public affairs and can pursue their own vision of the good, provided they do not infringe on the same pursuit by other individuals."

### The Eight Democratic Anchors

**1. Rule of Law**
Links institutional values like legality, rational judgment, and privacy to democratic principles by constraining arbitrary state power and reinforcing democratic governance. Research questions might explore how these values prevent abuse of power, selective enforcement, and erosion of legal predictability.

**2. Input Impartiality** 
Connects values of neutrality, equality, impartiality, and procedural fairness to democratic ideals of equal treatment in administrative processes. This anchor addresses problems of politicization, favoritism in access, and hidden biases in decision-making.

**3. Output Impartiality**
Links equity to democratic principles by diminishing personal, professional, or other biases in substantive decision-making, addressing issues of favoritism in implementation and corruption.

**4. Political Accountability**
Connects collective will and balance to democratic governance by ensuring policy work aligns with public preferences and interests, addressing problems of bureaucratic opacity and undermining of pluralism.

**5. Administrative Accountability**
Links answerability and responsiveness to democratic legitimacy by connecting policy work with legislative mandates and scope, addressing procedural and outcome legitimacy concerns.

**6. Voice, Input and Enactment**
Connects balance, participation, transparency, and responsiveness to democratic participation by making administrative processes more comprehensible to citizens and informing political behavior.

**7. Quality of Outcomes**
Links efficiency, equity, and equality to democratic resource stewardship by balancing resource use with outcome quality, addressing over-prioritization of procedural interests and fairness concerns.

**8. Systemic Integrity**
Connects system value reinforcement, state stability, rational judgment, institutional resilience, and representation to overall democratic coherence, addressing institutional checks and balances, elite capture, and public trust.

### Research Applications

Each anchor generates specific research questions and highlights particular problems for democratic administration. For example, when studying transparency (linked to the "Voice, Input and Enactment" anchor), researchers might ask: "How do administrative reporting practices make government action comprehensible to citizens?" This could illuminate problems of institutional trust and adaptation to social needs.

## Implications and Future Research

### For Scholarship

Our framework provides several contributions to public administration scholarship:

1. **Conceptual Clarity**: By distinguishing institutional values from individual, professional, and organizational values, we offer a more precise analytical foundation for empirical research.

2. **Democratic Connection**: The eight anchors provide systematic ways to connect institutional values to democratic theory, enabling more rigorous examination of how administrative practice supports or undermines democratic governance.

3. **Research Agenda**: Each anchor suggests specific research questions and methodological approaches for investigating democratic values in administrative practice.

### For Practice

The framework offers practical guidance for public administrators by:

1. **Decision-Making Criteria**: Providing clear connections between everyday administrative choices and broader democratic principles.

2. **Training and Development**: Offering structured ways to think about values in administrative education and professional development.

3. **Evaluation Tools**: Enabling assessment of how well administrative practices support democratic governance.

### Contemporary Relevance

In an era of democratic backsliding worldwide, understanding how administrative institutions embed, transmit, and sometimes erode democratic values is critically important. Our framework provides tools for systematically assessing the role of public administration in both stabilizing and challenging democratic governance.

## Conclusion

This research addresses a significant gap in public administration scholarship by providing conceptual clarity about institutional values and their relationship to democratic governance. Through our systematic review of nearly 9,300 publications, we identified persistent ambiguity about the nature and operation of values in the field.

Our democratic anchors framework offers a constructive path forward, enabling scholars to systematically examine how institutional values shape administrative practice and democratic governance. By connecting commonly studied administrative values to fundamental democratic principles, we provide both analytical tools for researchers and practical guidance for administrators.

The framework recognizes that democratic governance involves both instrumental effectiveness and intrinsic commitments, acknowledging that means and ends are often intertwined in public administration. As democratic institutions face contemporary challenges, this research contributes to understanding how public administration can better support democratic ideals through value-guided practice.

Future research should build upon this framework to examine how democratic anchors operate in different institutional contexts, how they interact with one another, and how they can be strengthened to support democratic resilience in changing political environments.
